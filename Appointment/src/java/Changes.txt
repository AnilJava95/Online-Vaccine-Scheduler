Changed addAppointmentForm's Location section to create 1 table instead of N tables.
Moved the table creation outside the of the for statement.

chooseTime was checking all the parameters from addAppointmentForm but location. 
Now it checks that aswell.

chooseTime was using request.getParameter for the parameters twice. Once on top 
during the security check. And once in the hidden inputs. Now the hidden inputs 
use the variables created during the security checks.

chooseTime was checking whether parameters from addAppointmentForm were empty 
strings or not. But the radioButton ones needs to be checked whether they are 
null or not. This was fixed.

chooseTime renamed the variable timeSlot to timeSlotIndex. And changed the value 
of the radio buttons from timeSlot to timeSlot + 1 to make it match the database. 
1-5 instead of 0-4.

addAppointment used to turn timeSlot of the date false to mark it reserved. But 
it was only doing it for timeSlot values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. It wasn't reserving 
the timeSlot if the value was 5. And with the timeSlot + 1 change we made, we 
needed to check for 1-5 instead of 0-4.

deleteAppointment and editAppointment needed to be changed to use time slots of 
1-5 instead of 0-4.

AppointmentDao had an unused method edit. Now it is commented out.
